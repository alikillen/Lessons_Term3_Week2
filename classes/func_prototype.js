//  1. Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
// 2. JavaScript is often described as a prototype-based language â€” to provide inheritance,
// 3. objects can have a prototype object,
// 4. which acts as a template object that it inherits methods and properties from.
// just like we have "string".methods in ruby and class to group methods and provide inheritance. In Javascript we have prototypes which enables inheritance
